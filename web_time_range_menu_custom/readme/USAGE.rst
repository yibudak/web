For the pivots, on the comparison tab you can see the same option to make the 
comparison with the provided filter, taking th reference from the set filter.

**Note:** For "days," it functions as a range; for example, "Last 7 days" returns the 
period from 7 days ago up to today. However, for other options, it provides the 
range for the selected period. For instance, "Last 1 month" returns the period from 
the first day of the previous month to the last day of the previous month.
