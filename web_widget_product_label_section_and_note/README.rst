This module unifies the product and name into a single column, making it more user-friendly and space-saving.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To extend this functionality to other modules (for example, Purchase),
in a new module, it is necessary to create an inherited view to change the widget for these fields:

- `one2many` field with `widget="product_label_section_and_note_field_o2m"`.

- `product_id` or product_tmpl_id field with `widget="product_label_section_and_note_field"`.

- `name` field with `widget="section_and_note_text"`.

Usage
=====

- Go to the **Invoicing > Customers > Invoices** and add a new line.
- The product label must be displayed just after the product name.
- If the product does not have a description, a button must be displayed to add one.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Add compatibility with `sale_product_configurator` module
- Add compatibility with `purchase_product_matrix` module
- When this module is installed, the PDF report will always display the column `name` as a combination of the `product code`, `product name`, and `description`. This behavior may differ from the expected behavior, where only the column `name` is displayed and can be customized independently.
